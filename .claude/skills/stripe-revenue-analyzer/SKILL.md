## When This Skill Activates

This skill automatically activates for requests like:
- "Analyze my Stripe revenue"
- "Show me my top Stripe customers"
- "What's my subscription churn rate?"
- "Identify revenue patterns in my Stripe data"
- "How much MRR did we add this quarter?"
- "Which customers are at risk of churning?"
- "Analyze payment success rates"

## Instructions

When activated, follow these steps:

### 1. Data Collection

Request access to Stripe data for the specified time period:

**Required data sources:**
- Charges (successful payments, failures, refunds)
- Subscriptions (active, canceled, past_due)
- Customers (metadata, created dates, total spend)
- Invoices (paid, unpaid, failed)
- Payment intents (status, amounts, currencies)

**Validate data:**
- Confirm time range is clear (default: last 30 days)
- Check for data completeness
- Handle missing or null values gracefully

### 2. Revenue Trend Analysis

**Calculate key metrics:**
- Total revenue for period
- Revenue growth rate (vs previous period)
- Average transaction value
- Transaction count
- Revenue by day/week/month

**Identify trends:**
- Growth acceleration or deceleration
- Week-over-week momentum
- Month-over-month comparisons
- Quarter-over-quarter if applicable

**Format output:**
```
Total Revenue: $X (+Y% vs last period)
Avg Transaction: $Z
Transaction Count: N
Growth Trend: [Accelerating|Steady|Declining]
```

### 3. Top Customers Analysis

**Identify high-value customers:**
- Sort by total spend (all-time)
- Calculate percentage of total revenue
- Identify top 10% (whales)
- Flag recent high-value customers

**Calculate customer metrics:**
- Customer lifetime value (LTV)
- Average order value per customer
- Purchase frequency
- Days since last purchase

**Format output:**
```
Top 10 Customers:
1. [Name/ID]: $X (Y% of revenue)
   - Transactions: N
   - Avg Order: $Z
   - LTV: $A
   - Status: [Active|At Risk|Churned]
```

### 4. Subscription Health Analysis

**Calculate subscription metrics:**
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)
- Churn rate (monthly and annual)
- New MRR vs churned MRR
- Upgrade vs downgrade rates

**Identify at-risk subscriptions:**
- Past due invoices
- Payment failures
- Upcoming trial expirations
- Downgrade patterns

**Format output:**
```
MRR: $X (+Y% vs last month)
ARR: $Z
Churn Rate: A% (target: <5%)
New MRR: $B
Churned MRR: $C
Net MRR Growth: $D
```

### 5. Payment Success Analysis

**Calculate payment metrics:**
- Overall success rate
- Failure reasons breakdown
- Dispute rate
- Refund rate
- Average time to payment

**Identify issues:**
- Declining cards needing update
- Fraud patterns
- Geographic payment issues
- Currency-specific problems

**Format output:**
```
Payment Success Rate: X% (target: >94%)
Top Failure Reasons:
1. Card declined: Y%
2. Insufficient funds: Z%
3. Expired card: A%

Recommended Actions:
- Update X cards before next billing
- Contact Y customers with payment issues
```

### 6. Anomaly Detection

**Identify unusual patterns:**
- Revenue spikes (>30% above average)
- Revenue drops (>30% below average)
- Sudden churn increases
- Geographic concentration changes
- Product mix shifts

**Correlate with events:**
- Marketing campaigns
- Product launches
- Pricing changes
- Seasonal events
- External factors

**Format output:**
```
Anomalies Detected:
🚨 Revenue spike on [Date]: +X% vs daily average
   Correlation: [Event/Campaign]
   Recommendation: [Action to replicate or investigate]
```
